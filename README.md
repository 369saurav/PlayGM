## Data Collection and Processing

PLAY-GM collects extensive data from chess websites like chess365.com. The games are downloaded in PGN format and converted into FEN notation to capture the exact board state. This data is then vectorized and stored in a TiDB serverless database, allowing for quick retrieval and analysis during gameplay.

### Data Flow

1. **Data Scraping**: Extracting game data from online sources.
2. **Data Conversion**: Converting PGN files to FEN notation for precise board representation.
3. **Vectorization**: Transforming the data into numerical vectors representing grandmaster strategies.
4. **Storage**: Storing the vectorized data in a TiDB serverless database for efficient access.

## Future Plans

- **Additional Grandmasters**: Expanding the roster of grandmasters available in the app.
- **Game Analysis**: Introducing detailed game analysis features to provide insights into strategies and move effectiveness.
- **Advanced AI**: Developing an AI that combines strategies from multiple grandmasters to compete against top chess engines like AlphaZero.
